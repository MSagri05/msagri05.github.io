# Manmeet Sagri — Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, designed and developed to showcase my academic projects, skills, and creative work as a student in the School of Interactive Arts & Technology (SIAT) at Simon Fraser University.

The site highlights the projects I have completed across design, UX, web development, and Java-based interactive simulations. It is fully designed and coded by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
