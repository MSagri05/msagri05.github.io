          This project was completed as part of a three-person team for the Embark Sustainability Society. The
          requirement was to transform their Sustainable Project Funding Opportunities spreadsheet into a more usable
          and accessible website. Working within strict design parameters, we focused on reorganizing content into clear
          hierarchies, improving labels and link text, and building responsive layouts for both mobile and desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team collaborated on wireframing and prototyping before moving into development. Hind Hammad focused on
          HTML structure, I was responsible for CSS styling and layouts, and Yilin Gao contributed across both design
          and coding tasks. The final redesign produced an interactive website that emphasized usability, clarity, and
          accessibility.

      <!-- Week 1 -->
      <article class="pd-step">
        <h4>Week 1</h4>

        <div class="pd-grid">
          <img src="images/wireframeSketch.png" alt="Wireframe sketches for the webiste layouts" />
          <img src="images/figmaWireframe.png" alt="Wirefram on Figma" />
        </div>

        <p>
          We began by hand-sketching our individual wireframes to quickly explore different layout possibilities. Each
          team member then translated their sketches into low-fidelity wireframes using Figma. This allowed us to
          experiment with navigation structures, labeling choices, and layout ideas in both physical and digital
          formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing our drafts, we met as a group to share and compare our wireframes. Through discussion, we
          identified the strongest elements from each person’s design. Hind led the task of synthesizing these ideas
          into a single unified wireframe that reflected the best aspects of our collective thinking. This collaborative
          process gave us a strong foundation before moving into higher-fidelity prototyping in later weeks.
        </p>

      <!-- Week 2 -->
      <article class="pd-step">
        <h4>Week 2</h4>

        <div class="pd-grid">
          <img src="images/week2Progress.png" alt="Progress of wireframe using html and css" />
          <img src="images/indexCode.png" alt="HTML code for the in progress website" />
        </div>

        <p>
          We moved from wireframes into coding, starting with individual HTML and CSS practice. HTML was used to
          structure the content while CSS handled the styling and layouts. Our professor encouraged us to work
          independently at first to test our skills before merging efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we began building the final version, we ran into challenges with the scrolling effect, but Yilin figured
          out the solution and helped the team implement it successfully.

      <!-- Week 3 & 4 -->
      <article class="pd-step">
        <h4>Week 3 &amp; 4</h4>

        <div class="pd-grid">
          <img
            src="images/finalPrototype.png"
            alt="Final Figma Prototype on Figma considereing the color palettes"
          />
          <img src="images/finalWeb.png" alt="Final Website Look" />
        </div>

        <p>
          I refined the wireframes into a polished prototype, applying Embark’s official color palette, logos, and
          design assets. This ensured our redesign matched their branding standards. Using this prototype as a guide, I
          focused on the CSS styling for the final website, while Hind handled the HTML structure and layout fixes.
          Together, we aligned the design with both usability goals and the client’s visual identity.

    <!-- Challenges & Reflection -->
    <section class="section-spaced">
      <h3 class="section-title">Challenges and Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        This project was both fun and challenging, and it showed me the value of strong teamwork. Whenever one of us
        struggled in a certain area, we encouraged each other to try new roles and offered guidance along the way. I
        took the design role seriously, ensuring our prototype and final website followed Embark’s color palette,
        branding standards, and accessibility goals. One technical challenge we faced was the scrolling effect, which
        took trial and error until we figured it out together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, we received positive feedback for keeping the website simple, accessible, and easy to navigate for
        people exploring scholarship opportunities.
