          <em>Aladdin’s Treasure Hunt</em> is a side-scrolling platformer I created for IAT 167: Digital Games. The
          goal was to design and program a multi-level game in Processing with an emphasis on object-oriented
          programming and core mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built a narrative where Aladdin collects a hidden key to unlock a treasure and rescue Princess Jasmine
          while navigating moving platforms, enemies, and hazards. The game includes collectibles, level progression,
          health, and sound cues to enhance the atmosphere.

      <!-- Week 1 -->
      <article class="pd-step">
        <h4>Week 1</h4>
        <div class="pd-grid">
          <img src="images/storyboard.png" alt="Storyboard sketches for Aladdin level ideas" />
          <img src="images/UML.png" alt="UML diagram of game structure" />
        </div>
        <p>
          In the early stage, I finalized the idea of creating a multi-level side-scrolling game inspired by Aladdin. I
          developed a game proposal and storyboard to outline the narrative, level progression, and gameplay mechanics.
          To pre-plan the code structure, I created a UML diagram mapping out the classes, fields, and methods, ensuring
          encapsulation and object-oriented principles were applied from the start.
        </p>

      <!-- Week 2 -->
      <article class="pd-step">
        <h4>Week 2</h4>
        <div class="pd-grid">
          <img src="images/assets.png" alt="Assets and audio folder with sprites, sequences, and sounds" />
          <img src="images/readMe.png" alt="README credits and references for images and audio" />
        </div>
        <p>
          My next step was designing the UI elements. For this project, I created some assets directly in Java, such as
          simple UI shapes. The sequence animations for Aladdin’s running, jumping, and coin spinning were sourced from
          free websites, which I adapted to fit the game. I also designed a few custom elements myself in Figma,
          including the introduction letter image and health token. All assets, whether self-made, drawn in Java, or
          collected online, were organized into a central “data” folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also made sure to properly reference all borrowed sources, documenting image and audio credits in my README.
          This ensured transparency about which parts I designed myself and which were adapted from external resources.
        </p>

      <!-- Week 3 & 4 -->
      <article class="pd-step">
        <h4>Week 3 &amp; 4</h4>
        <div class="pd-grid">
          <img src="images/code.png" alt="Processing / Java code screenshot showing Character class and animation sequence" />
          <img src="images/gameplay.png" alt="Gameplay screenshot of Aladdin jumping across platforms and collecting coins" />
        </div>
        <p>
          I built the game using object oriented programming in Java, applying encapsulation to keep each class
          structured and reusable. Clear comments documented functionality and made the code easy to maintain. This
          organization allowed me to add features such as animations, sound effects, and level progression without
          disrupting the core system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the core features were programmed, I tested by playing through each level, refining collisions, platform
          movement, and triggers. Encapsulation also supported efficient debugging, helping me quickly locate and fix
          errors while improving polish and gameplay balance.

    <section class="section-spaced">
      <h3 class="section-title">Challenges and Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        One of the main challenges I faced was creating UI assets. Although the assignment allowed free online sources,
        the professor encouraged us to design our own elements. I created a few assets myself but relied heavily on
        external images, which taught me the importance of building more original UI in future projects. From my peers,
        I learned about tools such as Illustrator and Sketch.io, and I plan to use these for my next project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the feedback I received was positive, with a reminder to include more comments throughout my code.
        This reinforced the value of clear documentation alongside strong design and programming practices.
