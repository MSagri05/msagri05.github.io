          The Glazing Guide is a three-month IAT 333 project created in collaboration with Palette Art Studio.
          Customers often struggled with the multi-step glazing process due to verbal-only instructions, long
          colour-selection times, and crowding at the Paint Bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          To improve clarity and independence, we designed a system of three connected tools: a Digital
          Colour Guide, Table Infographics, and a Redesigned Chalkboard. Our process included field research,
          user interviews, weekly design retros, concept development, and multiple rounds of prototyping. The
          final solution makes the painting experience smoother and more intuitive for both customers and
          staff.

      <!-- Phase 1 -->
      <article class="pd-step">
        <h4>Phase 1: Research &amp; Discovery</h4>

        <div class="pd-grid">

        </div>

        <p>
          We began with field research at Palette Art Studio to understand how customers navigated the pottery
          painting process. Through on-site observations and customer interviews, we noticed that most
          instructions were delivered verbally, which led to confusion, forgotten steps, and long wait times
          at the Paint Bar. Our team also met with the studio owner to learn about her workflow and the
          challenges she faces during busy hours. This early research helped us map out the participant group,
          document customer pain points, and build a foundation for the project.

      <!-- Phase 2 -->
      <article class="pd-step">
        <h4>Phase 2: Synthesis &amp; Problem Framing</h4>

        <div class="pd-grid">

          <img src="images/persona.png" alt="Customer persona for Palette Art Studio visitors" />
        </div>

        <p>
          After gathering data, we organized our findings into personas, journey maps, and a reframed design
          problem. Customers needed clearer, more accessible guidance, while the studio needed a way to reduce
          repeated questions and crowding. Our weekly design retros helped us stay aligned, reflect on what
          was working, and identify areas for improvement as we moved into ideation.

      <!-- Phase 3 -->
      <article class="pd-step">
        <h4>Phase 3: Ideation &amp; Concept Development</h4>

          <img src="images/conceptReview.png" alt="Concept review and feedback with Palette Art Studio" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Using the insights from our research, we explored multiple concept directions through sketches and
          collaborative brainstorming sessions. As a team, we generated three early concepts, refined them
          into two stronger options, and prepared a workshop presentation. One of my key contributions during
          this phase was proposing the idea of a mobile-friendly HTML colour guide, which later shaped the
          direction of our final solution. Throughout these weeks, we met frequently to share ideas,
          reorganize content, and strengthen the clarity of our designs.

        </div>

        <p>
          We moved into detailed design work, creating the Digital Colour Guide, Table Infographics, and a
          redesigned Paint Bar chalkboard. Most of our visual design and layout decisions were explored
          directly in Figma, which made it easy to collaborate and iterate. I worked on the Digital Colour
          Guide’s interface, helping translate our research and ideas into a clean, simple prototype. We
          continuously refined the visuals, wording, and user flow, checking alignment through team critiques
          and weekly retros.

          <img src="images/infographic.png" alt="Final table infographic showing glazing instructions" />
        </div>

        <p>
          The final Glazing Guide combines three connected resources that support a smoother studio experience:
          the Digital Colour Guide helps customers browse colours independently; the Table Infographics
          provide simple illustrated instructions and FAQs; and the Redesigned Chalkboard gives clear,
          step-by-step guidance for choosing paint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, these interventions reduce crowding, lessen the studio owner’s workload, and help
          customers feel more confident throughout the glazing process.

    <!-- Challenges & Reflection -->

      <h3 class="section-title">Challenges and Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        This project ended up being the closest thing I have experienced to real professional work, and it
        genuinely changed how I approach design. My teammates had completed co-op terms before, so they
        understood how to stay organized, plan ahead, and give honest critiques. Working with them pushed me to
        level up, and I learned how valuable consistency, clear communication, and thoughtful feedback are in
        producing strong work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being part of a team that cared about quality motivated me to push my creativity further. I became more
        confident in sharing ideas, contributing to research, and taking ownership of key parts of the project,
        especially the Digital Colour Guide interface. Watching my teammates illustrate so confidently also
        encouraged me to build my own visual skills, which I continued to develop in my later projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through weekly critiques, retros, and constant check-ins, I learned how to communicate more clearly,
        stay on top of deadlines, and participate in ideation with more confidence. I also became more open to
        experimenting with visual work instead of avoiding it, and that helped me grow in ways I did not
        expect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, The Glazing Guide taught me how collaborative design really works and how much growth happens
        when you work with people who inspire you. I became more organized, more self-assured, and more willing
        to explore creativity outside my comfort zone. It helped me enjoy my projects more deeply and understand
        the designer I want to become.
